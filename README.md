Hello I write a code with chatgpt too intigrate the flowise ai assistent too the openweb ui. I canÂ´t give too much support but you can ask me everytime maybe I can help.


Please add https://docs.openwebui.com/pipelines/

and after the Container is running you can add the pipline.py to openwebui.

You need too change some in the code. For example the API URL.
